# Chapter notes


## Chapter 2

* Write a single HTML file by using React to display a server-less Hello World on the browser. The React library is supported by a Content Delivery Network (CDN) online and no local React is required. Therefore, it is called server-less. No hard work here.
* Use JSX to substitute React.createElement() calls to redo the Hello Word HTML file. Compiler Babel is imported to transform JSX into React.createElement() calls.
