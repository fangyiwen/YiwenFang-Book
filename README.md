# Chapter notes


## Chapter 6

* I have studied the MongoDB basics and CRUD operations on the localhost. Robo 3T is also installed as a GUI.
* MongoDB Node.js Driver is installed for the project. Try to repeat `npm install mongodb@3` several times since it may fail sometimes. Remember to add Mongo's bin folder to the path environment variable to use `mongo` in the cmd. The Callbacks Paradigm is used for `trymongo.js`.
* `testWithAsync()` within `trymongo.js` is used by implementing the async/await paradigm.

## Chapter 5

* I am starting doing Express and GraphQL. Express and REST API are investigated for its functions. The About API is a simple API in GraphQL. Note: graphql@14.2.1 is required to be installed for this part.
* Create GraphQL schema file separately from the JavaScript file. `fs` module and the `readFileSync` function are required to read the file into a string. Note: Add `-e js,graphql` to watch for changes in the server directory.
* Use the List API to fetch a list of issues. The tests are done via the Playground. Note: There is no comma separation for type Issue, Query, and Mutation in schema.graphql, as well as the query test in the Playground.
* Create List API Integration by fetching the data from the server for `loadData()`. Note: Use `await` keyword for asynchronous calls.
* Create Custom Scalar Types by using `scalar GraphQLDate` in the schema.graphql. A scalar type resolver is required in the server.js. Then the native Date type is converted in the App.jsx.
* Do The Create API by implementing an API for creating a new issue. Use `input` keyword for new input type `IssueInputs`. Note the format of comments for real documentation in the schema. Add `parseValue` and `parseLiteral` in the GraphQLDate resolver.
* Create API Integration by modifying the new issue in the UI. Pay attention the syntax `${}`. 
* Create Query Variables to deal with dynamic user input as arguments. Remember to use `$` before the variable names such as `$message`, and the variable needs to be declared before being accepted.
* Create Input Validations by implementing `enums` in the schema. `validateIssue()` is used for programmatic validations. The errors are generated by `UserInputError`. 
* Create Displaying Errors by dealing with transport errors. `graphQLFetch`, together with `try-catch`, is used in the App.jsx. `BAD_USER_INPUT` is used to check the type of errors.
* Here is the screen shot of the GraphQL "playground" displayed on localhost port 3000, with a successfully answered query.

## Chapter 4

* Use `this.state` to capture the state of a component. The initial state is done in the component constructor by assigning the hard-coded issues as values to the variables (keys).
* `this.setState()` is used to modify the state by inserting one argument containing issues as the key. Be sure to initialize the issues as empty array ([]) before using `this.setState()`. Asynchronous `this.setState()` is realized by using `setTimeout()`. `componentDidMount()` is called to ensure the DOM is guaranteed to be ready. Therefore, async state initialization is done.
* A new copy of updated array and object are needed before `this.setState` is performed. Note: `this.state` here is treated as immutable, and we can't operate directly on it. Remember to use a fresh array of issues in the `setState()` call.
* Lift state up to IssueList by moving the state and initial state loading method. Remember to use `this.props` to get data. Note: `bind` method is used to refer correct `this` for the correct scope.
* Create event handling by implementing `onClick` and `onSubmit` for the form. Remember to do `this.handleSubmit = this.handleSubmit.bind(this)`. Do not forget `preventDefault()` when clicking the Add button.
* Create stateless components by substituting component classes with functions. Note: The classes must have no states, but dependence on props is optional.
* Here is the screen shot of the Issue Tracker screen displayed on localhost port 3000.

## Chapter 3

* Start to use React components instantiated from React classes, extended from the base class React.Component, in the JSX file. Introduce render() method to display the component. An instance can be created by using \<HelloWorld />. Caution: render() can only return single value.
* Compose components of IssueLIst from three components, i.e., IssueFilter, IssueTable and IssueAdd. Pay attention to the Fragment component since it does something like \<div> but has no effect on the DOM.
* Pass data using properties from a parent component to a child component. The key point is to use this.props in the child component to access associated attributes in the parent component. Remember {} to switch into the JavaScript world.
* Pass data using children to let the parent component access the children element. The key point is to use this.props.children for the parent component. Remember to wrap components within a parent component.
* Do dynamic composition by using generated set of components from an array of issues instead of hard-coded set of components. Be careful about JavaScript expressions within the curly braces. Update CSS in index.html and toDateString() in App.jsx.
* Here is the screen shot of the Issue Tracker screen displayed on localhost port 3000.

## Chapter 2

* Write a single HTML file by using React to display a server-less Hello World on the browser. The React library is supported by a Content Delivery Network (CDN) online and no local React is required. Therefore, it is called server-less. No hard work here.
* Use JSX to substitute React.createElement() calls to redo the Hello Word HTML file. Compiler Babel is imported to transform JSX into React.createElement() calls.
* Install nvm and Node.js version 10. Install Express version 4. Be careful to choose the right version when typing the command line.
* Create an Express server to host a website by creating server.js. Be careful about the code order in Listing 2-3. Update package.json to change Start Script.
* Separate JSX from index.html by creating an external script App.jsx. Do not forget the file path for App.jsx in the index.html.
* Install Babel to locally transform JSX to pure JavaScript on build up. Update the script code block in the index.html.
* Install preset-env for older browsers support with syntactic changes. Browsers and their versions can be set in the .babelrc file. Update Babel polyfill in index.html to do new functions' implementations called polyfills.
* Update scripts of package.json with custom commands to do the automation by using Babel --watch option for recompiling source change and nodemon -w option for restarting server when server code is changed.
* Here is the screen shot of the Hello World screen displayed on localhost port 3000.
